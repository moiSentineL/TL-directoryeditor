# TLauncher Directory Editor

 The .properties Directory Editor for Portable TLauncher made by moiSentineL [here](https://github.com/moiSentineL/portabletl).
 
 This application written in [Python](https://www.python.org) will solve the problem of TLauncher not recognizing the current directory as the main `.minecraft` folder.
 
## Explaination

This application searches for the `tlauncher-2.0.properties` file inside the `.tlauncher` directory and edits the `minecraft.gamedir` value to the `.minecraft` folder existing in the USB Drive.

## How to Use

### Download the zip file from [here](https://github.com/moiSentineL/TL-directoryeditor/releases/download/1.0/tl-directoryeditor.zip)

Extract it onto the root folder of the Portable Minecraft (i.e. the folder which contains the `tlauncher.jar`.
Open the folder and run `tl-directoryeditor.exe`. You **MUST** run the file from correct directory,

**Correct Directory Example:**

```
ðŸ“¦ Root Folder
 â”£ ðŸ“‚tl-directoryeditor
 â”£    â”— ðŸ“œtl-directoryeditor.exe  <-------- You run this.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚JavaPortableLauncher
 â”£    â”— ðŸ“‚Data
 â”£       â”— ðŸ“‚AppData
 â”£          â”£ ðŸ“‚.minecraft
 â”£          â”— ðŸ“‚.tlauncher
 â”£             â”— ðŸ“œtlauncher-2.0.properties  <-------- The file which is going to be edited.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚CommonFiles
 â”— ðŸ“œtlauncher.jar  <-------- Make sure this file exists in the root directory.
```
